**Project Overview:**
I had the privilege to lead a transformative project for AtliQ in September 2023, aptly named "Business Insights 360." This project aimed to empower AtliQ to not only stay competitive in their market but also to thrive by making data-driven decisions. The key achievement of this project was the creation of a comprehensive and interactive Power BI dashboard that seamlessly integrated data from various sources, providing a holistic view of their business operations and performance.

**Project Objectives:**
- Develop a Power BI dashboard that allows AtliQ to visualize and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) across multiple business functions.
- Enable AtliQ to make data-driven decisions by providing real-time insights and trends.
- Implement advanced Power BI features to enhance the usability and interactivity of the dashboard.
- Ensure data accuracy and freshness through automated data refresh mechanisms.
- Empower AtliQ's team to utilize DAX functions for more sophisticated analysis.

**Key Project Tasks:**
1. **Data Integration:** Gathered and integrated data from various sources, including sales, marketing, finance, and operations, to create a unified dataset for analysis.

2. **Dashboard Creation:** Designed and developed a visually appealing Power BI dashboard that provided a 360-degree view of AtliQ's business performance. This included interactive charts, graphs, and KPI indicators.

3. **Advanced DAX Functions:** Leveraged advanced DAX functions like CALCULATE(), DIVIDE(), FILTER(), SWITCH(), SUMX(), DISTINCT(), ALLNOBLANKROW(), and SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR() to create calculated columns and measures that supported more in-depth analysis.

4. **Interactive Features:** Implemented features such as bookmarks for switching between two visuals, tooltips to display trends, and page navigation with buttons for a user-friendly experience.

5. **KPI Indicators:** Integrated key performance indicators (KPIs) throughout the dashboard, allowing AtliQ to quickly assess their performance against targets and benchmarks.

6. **Data Refresh:** Set up a personal gateway to ensure the automatic refresh of data at regular intervals, keeping the dashboard up-to-date with the latest information.

**Business Terms and Definitions:**
- **YTD (Year to Date):** Represents data accumulated from the beginning of the current calendar year up to the present date.

- **YTG (Year to Go):** Refers to the remaining part of the calendar year, starting from the present date and moving forward.

- **LY (Last Year):** Indicates data from the same period in the previous calendar year, allowing for year-over-year comparisons.

- **TG (Target):** Represents the predefined goals and objectives that AtliQ aims to achieve.

- **BM (Benchmark):** Refers to the industry standards or best practices that serve as a reference point for evaluating performance.

**Project Outcome:**
The "Business Insights 360" project delivered a powerful tool that enabled AtliQ to gain deeper insights into their business operations, make informed decisions, and stay ahead of their competitors. With this comprehensive Power BI dashboard, AtliQ's team could easily track their progress against targets, assess their performance against benchmarks, and adapt their strategies in real time. The utilization of advanced DAX functions and interactive features enhanced their analytical capabilities, making data analysis more accessible and actionable.

This project represented a significant milestone in AtliQ's journey towards data-driven excellence, and it laid the foundation for continuous improvement and growth in the future.
